NIST has two definitions:\r\n(1) \u201cThe process of providing a digital signature for a set of measurements securely stored in hardware, and then having the requester validate the signature and the set of measurements.\u201d\r\n(2) \u201cThe issue of a statement, based on a decision, that fulfillment of specified requirements has been demonstrated.\u201d\r\n\r\nDefinition (1) is consistent with RATS WG conventional wisdom (but they haven't officially adopted it). \r\nDefinition (2) is typically applied in the context of a manual workflow process but has been used in the context of (automated) SBOM.\r\n\r\nRATS Arch would describe SBOM workflows as \"Endorsements\" performed by \"Endorsers\".\r\n\r\nThe WIMSE definition is somewhere in between. RATS qualifies usage of the \"attestation\" term with \"remote\", which is helpful. Possibly, WIMSE should do something similar - as in \"workload attestation\"?\r\n\r\nIt may be relevant to describe WL Attestation both in terms of singleton WLs as well as a \"workflow\" of nodes. This suggests there is both a vertical (singleton) and a horizontal (workflow) aspect to workload attestation. \r\n\r\nFrom a WL identity perspective, that implies there could be both a nodal identity as well as an identity for a collection / cluster of nodes that cooperate to implement a workflow.\r\n\r\nA WL is typically deployed in post-manufacturing contexts (aka production networks). As such the RATS \"Endorsement\" terminology doesn't seem correct. Rather, each WL node would be regarded as a Relying Party (RP) that has as its input an Attestation Results message. But also, each WL node is an Attester. Hence, each WL nodes implements both the Attester and RP roles (as defined by RATS Arch). \r\n\r\nA set of WL nodes cooperating to achieve a collective task will have a collective attestation context, which is the combination of attestation results from each WL node. Each WL node will have a collection of Evidences from each measured component that contributes to the WL image and execution and an Attestation Result for the node.\r\n\r\nA collection of ARs therefore is needed to describe the trust for the workflow. A new concept is the idea that a summary Attestation Result may be needed that describes the trust properties of the workflow. An Attestation Results result (ARR) if you will?\r\n",

I've proposed some new wording for the Agent description. \r\n\r\nThe Server takes the role of issuing Bearer tokens or X.509 certificates to the Workload.  I was a little confused that there was no Attestation function performed by the Server in the diagram before my PR.   I think the Agent would be responsible for obtaining Workload credentials from the Server.  The \"Host Operating System and Hardware\" could provide the Agent with locally-signed Agent-credentials that are not useful for Workload to Workload communication.  The Agent could use these credentials when contacting the Server with the Workload Identity, to obtain Workload Identity Credentials suitable for Workload to Workload communication.  There may or may not be a security perimeter between the Workload and the Agent. ",

Therefore it seems that it is best if the format is determined within the trust domain.  Issuers of identity credentials within the trust domain will generate identifiers for workloads, there may be more than one issuer so the format of the identifier.  The overall scheme is defined by the trust domain, portions of the name space can be delegated to specific issuers.\r\nperhaps this is what you mean?   \r\n",

I think we really need to flesh out the concept of context (in particular authorization context) a bit more in order to have things make more sense.  \r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nSource workloads may send authenticated asynchronous and batch requests to destination workloads. A destination workload may need to fulfill such requests with requests to authorized upstream protected resources and workloads, after the source workload credentials have expired. Credentials identifying the original source workload as subject may need to be obtained from the credential issuing authority with appropriately-downscoped context needed access to upstream workloads. These credentials should identify the workload as the actor in the actor chain, but may also identify other principals that the action is taken on behalf. To mitigate risks associated with long-duration credentials, these credentials should be bound to the workload identity credential such as an X.509 certificate or Workload Identity Token (WIT) of the acting service performing asynchronous computation on the source workload's behalf.\r\n```",
