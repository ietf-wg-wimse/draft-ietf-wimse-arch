NIST has two definitions:\r\n(1) \u201cThe process of providing a digital signature for a set of measurements securely stored in hardware, and then having the requester validate the signature and the set of measurements.\u201d\r\n(2) \u201cThe issue of a statement, based on a decision, that fulfillment of specified requirements has been demonstrated.\u201d\r\n\r\nDefinition (1) is consistent with RATS WG conventional wisdom (but they haven't officially adopted it). \r\nDefinition (2) is typically applied in the context of a manual workflow process but has been used in the context of (automated) SBOM.\r\n\r\nRATS Arch would describe SBOM workflows as \"Endorsements\" performed by \"Endorsers\".\r\n\r\nThe WIMSE definition is somewhere in between. RATS qualifies usage of the \"attestation\" term with \"remote\", which is helpful. Possibly, WIMSE should do something similar - as in \"workload attestation\"?\r\n\r\nIt may be relevant to describe WL Attestation both in terms of singleton WLs as well as a \"workflow\" of nodes. This suggests there is both a vertical (singleton) and a horizontal (workflow) aspect to workload attestation. \r\n\r\nFrom a WL identity perspective, that implies there could be both a nodal identity as well as an identity for a collection / cluster of nodes that cooperate to implement a workflow.\r\n\r\nA WL is typically deployed in post-manufacturing contexts (aka production networks). As such the RATS \"Endorsement\" terminology doesn't seem correct. Rather, each WL node would be regarded as a Relying Party (RP) that has as its input an Attestation Results message. But also, each WL node is an Attester. Hence, each WL nodes implements both the Attester and RP roles (as defined by RATS Arch). \r\n\r\nA set of WL nodes cooperating to achieve a collective task will have a collective attestation context, which is the combination of attestation results from each WL node. Each WL node will have a collection of Evidences from each measured component that contributes to the WL image and execution and an Attestation Result for the node.\r\n\r\nA collection of ARs therefore is needed to describe the trust for the workflow. A new concept is the idea that a summary Attestation Result may be needed that describes the trust properties of the workflow. An Attestation Results result (ARR) if you will?\r\n",

      "body": "In my opinion the document (and also draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol) is under-communicating the possibility and advantages of binding tokens to workload identities.\n\nConsider a scenario where you use RFC8705 or RFC9449 to request a token. The resulting token will be bound to either the mTLS certificate or the key in the proof token. The example in https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-03.html#name-option-1-dpop-inspired-auth effectively binds the WIT to the workload, the WIT is workload-bound. The example https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-03.html#name-using-mutual-tls-for-worklo doesn't mention using RFC8705 to get workload-bound tokens.\n\nI think that the architecture document should be much clearer on the possibility of binding tokens to workloads. For instance the recent https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/228/ipd does a very good job at explaining that there is typically at least two factors involved 1) an authentication of the software/workload making the request, 2) some type of token relaying authorization context.\n\nI think we are greatly under-communicating the possibility of using the workload identity authentication to bind tokens (that contains authorization context) to the workload identity itself. This token could be an oauth token or indeed a transaction token (if txn-tokens were extended to support cnf claims). This has big benefit of giving another layer of defense because these tokens could not be stolen or misused by other workloads or systems.\n\nIn general I think that NIST SP 800-228 does a better job at explaining the \"factors\" involved in \"API Protection for Cloud-Native Systems\" -- which is effectively what WIMSE also aims to \"solve\" -- secure workload to workload communication. By authenticating a workload you have actually primed any tokens within your trust domain to be workload-bound which would greatly improve token security without much extra work.\n\nMy main point is that by having valid Workload Identity Credentials as either X.509 certificate or WIT, you have the ability to bind any or all tokens within your trust domain. The WIT/WPT pattern in s2s document actually is a form of workload-bound tokens, but it doesn't make it very clear. However this can easily be extended to binding other tokens via a RFC8705 flow or dPoP-like flows.  ",

All key material must be rotated and stored securely, which means that these key pairs have these considerations.

Think: Amazon Role and the way an EC2 instance can access secrets that are physically restricted to be used only by that instance to authenticate to the cloud infra and obtain a short-term credential that proves that authn took place.\n\nThe current section's text is too simplistic, and I would recommend to bring it more in line with Sec. 3.2 of draft-ietf-wimse-workload-identity-practices (Credential Issuance).\n\n(Also related to #59.)",

I've proposed some new wording for the Agent description. \r\n\r\nThe Server takes the role of issuing Bearer tokens or X.509 certificates to the Workload.  I was a little confused that there was no Attestation function performed by the Server in the diagram before my PR.   I think the Agent would be responsible for obtaining Workload credentials from the Server.  The \"Host Operating System and Hardware\" could provide the Agent with locally-signed Agent-credentials that are not useful for Workload to Workload communication.  The Agent could use these credentials when contacting the Server with the Workload Identity, to obtain Workload Identity Credentials suitable for Workload to Workload communication.  There may or may not be a security perimeter between the Workload and the Agent. ",

Issuers of identity credentials within the trust domain will generate identifiers for workloads, there may be more than one issuer so the format of the identifier.

I think we really need to flesh out the concept of context (in particular authorization context) a bit more in order to have things make more sense.  \r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nSource workloads may send authenticated asynchronous and batch requests to destination workloads. A destination workload may need to fulfill such requests with requests to authorized upstream protected resources and workloads, after the source workload credentials have expired. Credentials identifying the original source workload as subject may need to be obtained from the credential issuing authority with appropriately-downscoped context needed access to upstream workloads. These credentials should identify the workload as the actor in the actor chain, but may also identify other principals that the action is taken on behalf. To mitigate risks associated with long-duration credentials, these credentials should be bound to the workload identity credential such as an X.509 certificate or Workload Identity Token (WIT) of the acting service performing asynchronous computation on the source workload's behalf.\r\n```",

When interacting with external systems, exposing such details may inadvertently provide attackers with insights into the internal deployment structure, scaling strategies, security policies, technologies in use, or failover mechanisms, potentially giving them a tactical advantage. In such cases, an identity proxy at the trust boundary can generalize the workload identity by replacing the specific microservice instance name with the name of the overall service. This allows external parties to recognize the service while abstracting internal deployment details.\r\n```",

For example, it is common for a workload to require information about a user or other entity that originated the request. Other types of information may include information about the hardware or software that the workload is running or information about what processing and validation has already been done to the request. This type of information is part of the security context that the workload uses during authorization, accounting and auditing. This context is propagated and possibly augmented from workload to workload using tokens. The context may be associated with a specific source or target workload by binding it to a specific workload identifier. This may indicate that the context originated from a specific workload, or that only a specific workload may make use of the context. A workload may also use a workload identity credential to bind a context to one or more transaction so the receiver can verify which workload initiated the transaction and the context that was intended for the transaction.\r\n```",
